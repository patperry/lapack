Building
========

To build the package, there is no need to run the configure script.  Just
use the standard cabal commands:

    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
    runhaskell Setup.lhs build
    runhaskell Setup.lhs install
    
The package uses a script to find what BLAS and LAPACK libraries to link with.
To link with a custom BLAS, add the "--with-blas=<lib>" argument to --configure-option; to link with a custom LAPACK, add the the
"--with-lapack=<lib>" argument.  For example, do

    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --configure-option="--with-blas=<lib>"

To build this package from the repository, first run

    aclocal -I m4
    autoreconf


Thread-Safety
=============
The thread safety of the library depends on the thread-safety of the underlying
LAPACK implementation.  You should note that the reference implementation of
LAPACK (which is what ATLAS uses) is *not* thread safe.  Any routine which
modifies a read-only argument and then restores it is problematic.  Potentially
dangerous functions which get used in the library include the following:
DORMQR, ZUNMQR.
