To build the package, there is no need to run the configure script.  Just
use the standard cabal commands:

    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
    runhaskell Setup.lhs build
    runhaskell Setup.lhs install
    
The package uses a script to find what BLAS and LAPACK libraries to link with.
To link with a custom BLAS, add the "--with-blas=<lib>" argument to --configure-option; to link with a custom LAPACK, add the the
"--with-lapack=<lib>" argument.  For example, do

    runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --configure-option="--with-blas=<lib>"

To build this package from the repository, first run

    aclocal -I m4
    autoreconf
